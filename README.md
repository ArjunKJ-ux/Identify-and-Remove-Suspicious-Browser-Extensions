# Identify-and-Remove-Suspicious-Browser-Extensions
The goal of this task was to check my web browsers (Chrome and Firefox ) for any suspicious or unnecessary extensions, review their permissions, and remove anything that could pose a security risk.

##  Browsers Tested

###  Google Chrome
- Opened `chrome://extensions`
- No extensions were found installed.
- Screenshot proof is attached.
-  No action needed.

###  Mozilla Firefox
- Opened `about:addons` in the address bar
- Found these extensions installed:
  1. **Absolute Enable Right Click & Copy** – used to enable right-clicking on websites
  2. **Clear Browsing Data** – helps clean cookies, cache, and history
  3. **Gesturefy** – adds gesture controls
  4. **Read Aloud** – reads webpages using TTS (Text-to-Speech)
  5. **Tab Stash** – saves open tabs into groups

 I reviewed all of these and found **no suspicious or harmful behavior**. I chose to keep them as they serve useful purposes and have good reputations.
